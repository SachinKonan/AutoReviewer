       "   'review': \"The paper proposes a zeroth-order optimization framework that employs an RNN to modulate the sampling used to estimate gradients and a second RNN that models the parameter update. More specifically, query directions are sampled from a Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance whose evolution is determined by an RNN (QueryRNN). The resulting gradient estimates are used by an RNN (UpdateRNN) that learns the parameter update rule. This framework has the stated advantage that, unlike existing work in ZO optimization, it does not rely upon hand-designed strategies to reduce the variance common to ZO gradient estimators. The paper evaluates the proposed framework on MNIST and CFAR tasks, as well as a synthetic binary classification task. The results demonstrate faster convergence compared to baseline zeroth-order optimization algorithms, while ablations indicate the contributions of the different model components.\\n\\nThe primary contribution of the proposed method is the inclusion of a second network that learns to adapt the covariance of the Gaussian from which  query directions are sampled. The use of an RNN to model the parameter update rule is borrowed from previous work. The ablation studies show that the adaptive sampling strategy noticeably improves convergence as does the inclusion of the RNN update (the contribution of UpdateRNN is more significant in one ablation study, while the contribution of QueryRNN is greater in the other). \\n\\nGiven that a stated advantage of QueryRNN is reducing variance, it would be beneficial to compare against baselines such as Liu et al., 2018a,b and/or Guo et al., 2016 which similarly seek to reduce variance.\\n\\nThe paper includes a large number of typos (e.g., CIFAR-->CIAFR) and grammatical errors, but is otherwise clear.\\n\\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS/QUESTIONS\\n\\n* The related work discussion would benefit from a discussion of how Liu et al. 2018 and Guo et al. 2016 reduce variance\\n\\n* The computational complexity of the proposed method as compared to the baselines is unclear as is the scalability with dimensionality. At various points, the paper comments that other methods scale poorly with the dimensionality of the query space, which is true of the proposed method unless the operations are parallelized. Is this not possible with the baseline methods?\\n\\n* The paper makes hand wavy claims to the fact that modulating the diagonal covariance matrix allows the method to focus on certain subspaces. It would be helpful to make these claims more formal, particularly in light of the fact that the mean does not change.\\n\\n* The method relies upon a bit of a hack that samples from a standard Gaussian at random times. How important is this to performance? How sensitive is convergence to the frequency with which standard Gaussian sampling is used?\\n\\n* The discussion of Eqn. 5 as it relates to Eqn. 1 is unclear.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE\\n\\nI appreciate the authors' thorough response, which resolved my primary questions/concerns, including comparisons to existing variance reduction methods (which should be incorporated into the main paper).\",\n",

       "   'comment': 'Thank you for your comments and suggestions! Here are our responses to your questions.\\n\\nQ5: Pros and cons of L2L? It seems that training a L2L network is not easy. Does its advantage exist only when inference? A better discussion should be made.\\n\\nApplying the L2L framework can lead to several promising advantages:\\n 1. Improving hand-designed algorithms with learned optimization rules: Currently, when solving specific classes of ML problems, we have to select from a big family of optimization algorithms and laboriously tune the hyperparameters. However, we can only obtain the tuned algorithms to the best of our knowledge and it’s difficult and laborious for us to design a better one. The L2L framework enables us to use the learned optimizer to automatically learn the optimization rules tailored to specific classes of optimization problems by exploring the particular loss landscapes. Our experimental results have shown that the learned optimizer can outperform highly tuned hand-designed algorithms.\\n2. Generalization across specific classes of problems: The learned optimizer is trained on a small subset of optimization problems and apply in a wide range of problems in similar classes. To illustrate, in the black-box adversarial attack task, we only used 100 images (corresponding to 100 different optimization problems in this class) to train the optimizer and the learned optimizer could be applied to solve optimization problems on all other test images (serving as an online “attacker”). The improvements the learned optimizer brings about in the class of problems can outweigh the overhead of training in a small subset.\\n3. Generalization to different classes of problems: In our experiments, we proposed a simple finetune scheme for applying the learned optimizer to different classes of optimization problems (see Section 4.3) and the experimental results showed that the learned optimizer could learn a rather general optimization rules. It means that probably there’s no need to train the optimizer from scratch when applied in new classes of problems. It also leads to a possible future direction of the L2L framework: pretraining the optimizer on difficult optimization problems and applying in general classes of problems with or without finetuning.\\n\\nThe main disadvantage of L2L is the difficulty to theoretically prove its convergence rate and extra training overhead (if the optimizer has to be trained from scratch). In our future work, we aim to prove the improved convergence in theory and further improve the training methodology. We have added more discussion in the conclusion part.'},\n",

       "   'comment': \"Thank you for your comments and suggestions! Here are our responses to your questions. \\n\\nQ1: The knowledge that one should use to train UpdateRNN and QueryRNN is not clear. A clear presentation is required \\n\\nThe performance of the RNN optimizer is measured by that of the optimizee whose parameter updates are proposed by the RNN optimizer. Thus, we can use the optimizee loss function as part of the objective function (as described in equation (4)) to directly train the parameters of both the UpdateRNN and the QueryRNN, which can be done by truncated BPTT. Note that we use zeroth-order optimization method for training the optimizer if the gradients of the optimizee are not available in the training stage either (as described in Section 3.3), the only knowledge we need to train the optimizer is function values rather than explicit gradients of the optimizee. So our method can be applied as long as the function values of the optimizee are available.\\n\\n\\nQ2: Please clarify the optimization variables in (4). In general, the problem is not clearly defined. \\n\\nSorry for the confusion. To define the objective function (4) more clearly, we rewrite the optimizee’s parameters \\\\theta_t as \\\\theta_t(\\\\phi) since \\\\theta_t is updated by the RNN optimizer as in equation (2) and thus determined by the RNN optimizer’s parameters \\\\phi. In a slight abuse of notation, we can also rewrite the predicted covariance matrix \\\\Sigma_t as \\\\Sigma_t(\\\\phi) since it is proposed by the QueryRNN as in equation (3). The exact optimization variables in equation (4) are the RNN optimizer’s parameters \\\\phi which include the parameters of both the UpdateRNN and the QueryRNN. We have revised Section 3.2 in the paper to make it more clear.\\n\\n\\nQ3: Eq. 5 is a query-expensive gradient estimate. Will it make training extremely expensive?\\n\\nFor problems of high dimensions, the coordinatewise ZO gradient estimator in equation (5) does require function queries linearly scale with the problem dimension. But this estimator can be computed in parallel, the computational overhead would be released a lot. We have experimented with the MNIST attack task (the problem dimension is 784) to estimate the computation overhead. We compare two methods:\\n1) use equation (5) to approximate the optimizee gradient. \\n2) assume the gradient of the optimizee model is available at training time and use traditional backpropagation (note that this assumption is made in Chen et al. (2017b) but is usually not the case, so we only use this method as the baseline for comparison). \\nWe find that the training time of 1) is about twice that of 2), which is acceptable. Moreover, potentially there could be several approaches to further reduce training time, such as sampling d'<d dimensions to estimate the gradient in equation (5) at each iteration.\\n\\n\\nQ4: The computation and query complexity are unclear during training and testing.\\n\\nIn the training stage, at each step of the forward pass, the optimizer uses equation (1) to obtain ZO gradient estimator whose query complexity is O(q) where q is the query number. In the backward pass, to backpropagate through the optimizee model, we apply coordinatewise ZO gradient estimator in equation (5) to approximate its gradient and its query complexity is O(d) where d is the problem dimension. Thus, for each step of the training stage, the total query complexity is O(q+d). If the gradient of the optimizee is available during training (which is the assumption made in Chen et al. (2017b)), we can use direct backpropagation instead of gradient estimation to train the zeroth-order optimizer, so the query complexity reduces to O(q). Note that both equation (1) and (5) can be computed in parallel to reduce computation time. \\n\\nIn the testing stage (when using the optimizer to solve a given optimization problem), we only need to compute equation (1) for the forward pass. So for each step, the total query complexity is O(q). This is the same with other hand-designed ZO optimizers. \\n\\nFor the computation complexity, most of the ZO optimizers (including the proposed one) have time complexity proportional to the number of queries, so the same observations will hold also for computation complexity. \"},\n",

       "   'comment': 'Thank you for your comments and suggestions! Here are our responses to your questions.\\n\\nQ5: The paper makes hand wavy claims to the fact that modulating the diagonal covariance matrix allows the method to focus on certain subspaces. It would be helpful to make these claims more formal, particularly in light of the fact that the mean does not change.\\n\\nAs for why modulating the diagonal covariance matrix allows our method to focus on certain subspace, we can simply consider the two-dimensional optimization problem. By using standard Gaussian distribution, we sample query directions from a circle and the probability distribution is isotropy. But by using the predicted diagonal covariance, we sample query directions from an ellipse and the probability distribution will be biased toward a certain axis, which means we increase the sampling probability in a certain subspace instead of uniformly sampling in the full space.\\n\\nAs for the sampling mean, in fact, we have experimented with also predicting the sampling mean but it tends to make the learned optimizer easily stuck at local optima. Thus, we just fix the zero mean and predict the sampling covariance.\\n\\n\\nQ6: The method relies upon a bit of a hack that samples from a standard Gaussian at random times. How important is this to performance? How sensitive is convergence to the frequency with which standard Gaussian sampling is used?\\n\\nWe have conducted another experiment (added to Appendix C.3) on the MNIST attack task to analyze the sensitivity of the final loss and iteration complexity w.r.t to the sampling frequency. As the sampling frequency varies from 0 to 1, we observe that the number of iterations drops significantly while the converged loss is relatively stable (from 2.25 to 2.31). This suggests the algorithm is not very sensitive to this parameter and in practice we can set the sampling frequency to a larger number. In our experiments, we simply set the sampling frequency to 0.5 without extra tuning. Please refer to Appendix C.3 for more details.\\n\\n\\nQ7: The discussion of Eqn. 5 as it relates to Eqn. 1 is unclear.\\n\\nEquation (1) and equation (5) are both widely used zeroth-order gradient estimators but play different roles in our proposed method. The gradient estimator in equation (1) serves as the input of our UpdateRNN to propose the parameter update. To reduce query complexity, we usually only sample a small number of query directions and approximate gradients along sampled query directions. But the function of equation (5) is completely different. Since our objective function (equation (4)) of training the optimizer contains the loss function of the optimizee whose gradients are not available in zeroth-order setting, we cannot backpropagate through it directly. To make training feasible, we use the gradient estimator in equation (5) to approximate the gradient of the optimizee. This estimator is deterministic and could achieve an accurate estimate to stabilize training if the smoothing parameters {\\\\mu_i} are sufficiently small, but requires query complexity scaled with problem dimension. Thus, we apply parallelization to compute equation (5) to reduce the computation overhead.\\n'},\n",

       "   'comment': 'Thank you for your comments and suggestions! Here are our responses to your questions. \\n\\nYour first and third questions are both about existing variance reduced methods for zeroth-order optimization. We make response to these two questions together. \\n\\nQ1: Given that a stated advantage of QueryRNN is reducing variance, it would be beneficial to compare against baselines such as Liu et al., 2018a,b and/or Guo et al., 2016 which similarly seek to reduce variance.\\n\\nQ3: The related work discussion would benefit from a discussion of how Liu et al. 2018 and Guo et al. 2016 reduce variance\\n\\nAbout related work: ZO-SVRG (Liu et al.,2018b) reduced the variance of random samples by dividing optimization steps into several epochs and maintaining a snapshot point at each epoch whose gradient was estimated using a larger or the full batch. And the snapshot point served as a reference in building a modified stochastic gradient estimate at each inner iteration. ZO-SZVR-G (Liu et al.,2018a) adopted a similar strategy and extended it to reduce the variance of both random samples and random query directions. AsyDSZOVR (Gu et al., 2016) applied a similar variance reduction method in the asynchronous zeroth-order optimization setting. We have added this discussion to the related work part.\\n\\nComparison with existing methods: Since ZO-SZVR-G is the extension of ZO-SVRG and AsyDSZOVR applies in a different optimization setting (asynchronous zeroth-order optimization), we only compare ZO-SZVR-G with our proposed method. We have conducted experiments on MNIST attack task which have been included in Appendix C.4. The main result is that ZO-SZVR-G converges faster than ZO-SGD because of reduced variance but leads to higher final loss values, whereas our QueryRNN brings about improvements both in terms of convergence rate and final loss. Since ZO-SZVR-G requires extra queries to reduce variance at each iteration and each epoch, we also plot the training loss against query number and observe that ZO-SZVR-G needs more queries than ZO-SGD and our method.\\n\\n\\nQ2: The paper includes a large number of typos (e.g., CIFAR-->CIAFR) and grammatical errors, but is otherwise clear.\\n\\nWe are sorry for our mistakes and have corrected them in the revised version.\\n\\n\\nQ4: The computational complexity of the proposed method as compared to the baselines is unclear as is the scalability with dimensionality. At various points, the paper comments that other methods scale poorly with the dimensionality of the query space, which is true of the proposed method unless the operations are parallelized. Is this not possible with the baseline methods?\\n\\nSorry for the confusion. For ZO optimizers it’s common to compare the number of queries (or the number of iterations in our experiments because the number of queries is the same at each iteration) required to obtain a certain objective function value, so “scalability” here mainly indicates the number of queries. In all the comparisons, our method can reduce the number of queries over existing optimizers. Also, we plot the number of queries with respect to dimensionality in Appendix C.1 to illustrate the effectiveness of the QueryRNN in terms of scalability with problem dimensions. \\n\\nFor the parallelization of equation (5), it is only for accelerating training rather than improving the scalability of our method. In the comparisons of our method with baseline methods, all methods use the same number of queries at each iteration and we plot the loss against the query (or iteration) number, so the parallelization does nothing to the comparison.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': {'value': \"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable flexibility in adopting different personas and behaviors. Existing approaches typically adapt such behavior through external knowledge such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning. We ask: do LLMs really need external context or parameters to adapting to different behaviors, or do they already have such knowledge embedded to their parameters?\\nIn this work, we show that LLMs already contain persona-specialized subnetworks in their parameter space. Using small calibration datasets, we identify distinct activation signatures associated with different personas. Guided by these statistics, we develop masking strategy that isolate lightweight persona subnetworks. Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing sub-network from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? \\nTo further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free, and rely solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that requires external knowledge while being more efficient. Our findings suggest that diverse human-like behaviors are not merely induced in LLMs, but are already embedded in their parameter space—pointing toward a new perspective on controllable and interpretable personalization in large language models.

We would like to summarize the discussion between the reviewers and us. \\n\\n* Both Reviewer **6VkV** and Reviewer **NkPg** have confirmed the clearance of concerns and raised the score to 6 after the discussion. Specifically,\\n     * We have conducted additional experiments to verify the explainability of our model (raised by both Reviewer 6VkV and Reviewer NkPg), as our method can also serve as an interpretability probe of personalization.\\n     * We have conducted experiments to investigate the difference between the base model and the instruction-tuned model (raised by Reviewer 6VkV ).  Besides the original experiments on Llama-3-8B and Llama-2-13B, we have also extended the experiments to Qwen2.5 following Reviewer 6VkV 's suggestion.\\n     * To address Reviewer NkPg's concern regarding flexible configuration, we claim that our method supports mixed masks (70\\\\% of the “introversion” subnetwork and 30\\\\% of the parameters of the “introversion” subnetwork with the largest magnitudes). \\n     * We conducted additional experiments to investigate the impact of personalization on two general abilities (raised by Reviewer NkPg): reasoning and language understanding.\\n     * We have investigated the sensitivity of our method to the size of the calibration data following Reviewer NkPg's suggestion.\\n     * Reviewer NkPg feels our newly added experiments are **very interesting** and we have integrated all new content into the revised version.\\n* We respectfully believe that both reviewers' engagement took place before the software bug incident reported on November 27 by ICLR.\\n* Despite Reviewer T1BF and Reviewer zm69 not being able to participate in the discussion, some shared concerns have been cleared by other reviewers.\\n     * Following Reviewer T1BF 's suggestion, we have introduced layer-aware pruning to address less distinct personas (weakness-1).\\n     * To address Reviewer T1BF 's concern about the generalization of our method on different architectures of LLM (weakness-2), we extended the experiment to Qwen. This concern has been cleared by Reviewer 6VkV.\\n     * While Reviewer T1BF suggests using a larger calibration dataset (weakness-3), Reviewer NkPg expected us to use fewer samples for the cost concern. The experiments show that our method is not overly sensitive to calibration dataset size, and even small, potentially noisy calibration sets are already sufficient.\\n     * Reviewer zm69 has the same comments as Reviewer NkPg about the effect of pruning on general performance (weakness-1 from Reviewer zm69 ). With new experiments on reasoning and language understanding, the concern has been cleared by Reviewer NkPg.\\n     * To clarify the precise mechanism of the contrastive pruning algorithm (weakness-2 from Reviewer zm69), we have added a paragraph to indicate that the underlying activation distributions of two personas are non-overlapping. Following Reviewer zm69's suggestion, we have reported Jaccard overlap and investigated the performance between opposite personas and similar personas.\\n     * We have added a paragraph and a table to further clarify Figure 3 (weakness-3 from Reviewer zm69).\\n     * We have moved Figure 1 to page 4 following Reviewer zm69's suggestion (weakness-4).\\n     * Reviewer zm69's question about the instruction-tuned models has also been raised by Reviewer 6VkV. By comparing the base model with the instruction-tuned models in new experiments, the concern has been cleared by Reviewer 6VkV.\\n \\nWe have integrated all comments and new experiments in the revised version. All changes are highlighted in blue.\\n\\n Lastly, we would like to once again thank the ACs and all reviewers for their contributions to the community.\"}},\n",

       "     'comment': {'value': \">**Weakness-4: Sensitivity to calibration data and sparsity**\\n\\n**Response:** We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the sensitivity of our method to calibration data and sparsity-related hyperparameters. To directly evaluate whether calibration size affects performance or introduces bias, we conduct a new experiment on the Role-Agent benchmark, using calibration sets of different sizes (5, 10, 20, 50, 100 samples). For each size, we randomly subsample the calibration pool and compute the subnetwork masks using the same procedure as in the main paper.\\nThe results show a clear saturation trend: performance improves rapidly from 5 to 20 samples, but additional data beyond 20 brings only marginal gains. This demonstrates that our method does not require thousands of samples, and small calibration sets are already sufficient to capture the relevant activation patterns. The masks are therefore robust to both calibration size and potential noise in the data.\\n\\n| Calibration Size | Sherlock (%) | Friends (%) | The Big Bang Theory (%) |\\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\\n| 5 | 39.69 | 29.59 | 31.82 |\\n| 10 | 43.65 | 30.61 | 38.64 |\\n| 20 | 46.83 | 33.67 | 45.45  |\\n| 50 | 47.62 | 35.71 | 47.73 |\\n| 100 | 50.79 | 36.73 | 50.00 |\\n\\nThese results confirm that the method is not overly sensitive to calibration sets size and that even small, potentially noisy calibration sets are already sufficient to extract stable subnetworks, while further increasing data brings only marginal improvements; therefore, the imperfect separation observed in a few persona types is more likely due to the model’s intrinsic representational structure rather than limitations of the calibration data.\\n\\nIn section 4.3, we have investigated the impact of sparsity ratio on persona specialization quality. Same as the impact of sparsity on general performance (e.g., accuracy) [1, 2], different sparsity levels reshape the dimensional profiles of different personas. While there are a lot of technologies (e.g., one-shot) that have been proposed to speed up the pruning, the cost of pruning is very small compared with training-based personalization methods. Since our method does not rely on large calibration data, we can further reduce the cost of turning the sparsity parameter by changing it with an interval (e.g, 10%) around an empirical value in practice.\\n\\nOur insight is that the percentage of neurons activated plays a vital role in personalization. When the sparsity level is too low, there is a small part of neurons to enable divergence. When the sparsity level is too high,  the neurons are not enough neurons to encode personality. Also, our method can serve as an interpretability probe in practice. Lastly, we remark that pruning can actually speed up the inference of LLMs.\\n\\n[1] A Simple and Effective Pruning Approach for Large Language Models\\n\\n[2] SparseGPT: Massive Language Models Can Be Accurately Pruned in One-Shot\\n\\n\\n> **Questions: Have you considered using mechanistic interpretability to find the LLM's identifiable internal computation paths?**\\n\\n**Response:** We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. Mechanistic interpretability is indeed a promising direction for understanding the internal computation pathways of LLMs. To provide more direct mechanistic evidence, we conducted a new causality-based analysis. The base Llama-3-8B model naturally shows an ENFJ persona, whereas applying the INFP subnetwork mask consistently yields INFP behavior. We then restored each linear layer individually while keeping all other layers masked. If restoring a layer moves the model back toward its original ENFJ tendency, this indicates that the masked parameters in that layer are causally necessary for implementing the INFP subnetwork.\\nAs shown in the table below, restoring most attention layers produces little change, while restoring specific MLP blocks causes clear, dimension-specific reversions (e.g., stronger J, stronger T), revealing the exact modules that carry the persona-specific computations. This confirms that the discovered subnetworks correspond to faithful and identifiable internal computation paths rather than correlational artifacts.\\n\\n| Configuration | I/E | S/N | T/F | P/J |\\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\\n| Full INFP mask | 12 / 2 | 4 / 16 | 3 / 17 | 15/ 4 |\\n| Restore L0.self_attn.q_proj | 11 / 3 | 5 / 15 | 3 / 17 | 17 / 2 |\\n| Restore L3.mlp.gate_proj | 9 / 5 | 8 / 12 | 9 / 11 | 6 / 13 |\\n| Restore L25.mlp.down_proj | 10 / 4 | 5 / 15 | 4 / 16 | 9 / 10 |\"}},\n",

       "     'comment': {'value': '>**Weaknesses-1: practical benefits**\\n\\n**Response:** We thank the reviewer for suggesting experiments involving mixed personas such as “70% introversion + 30% thinking.” We conducted this experiment by combining the corresponding subnetworks and applying the mixed mask to the model. Specifically, we combine 70% of the parameters with the largest magnitudes of the “introversion” subnetwork and 30% the parameters with the largest magnitudes of the “introversion” subnetwork. The results show that the method supports fine-grained and continuous persona control. The mixed model moves specifically toward introversion and thinking while keeping the remaining MBTI dimensions close to the original base model. This outcome indicates that the subnetworks discovered by our method combine in a predictable and interpretable way, allowing graded persona manipulation rather than being limited to discrete types.\\n| Model | I/E | S/N | T/F | P/J |\\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\\n| Base Model | 5/9 | 5/15 | 8/12 | 9/10 |\\n| 70% introversion + 30% thinking | 8/6 | 7/13 | 10/10 | 9/10 |\\n\\n\\n**Practice:** By combining different persona subnetworks, our method supports diverse and flexible configurations. At the same time, our method is flexible for quick persona switch by only introducing binary masks and requires only a small calibration dataset.\\n\\n>**Weaknesses-2: not applicable to closed-source models**\\n\\n**Response:** We agree with the reviewer that API-based persona control is an interesting direction. However, our method fundamentally relies on activation statistics and weight level pruning, which necessarily requires access to model parameters. Therefore, applying it to closed-source API-only models is outside the scope of pruning-based interpretability methods in general, not a limitation specific to ours.\\n\\n>**Weakness-3: Impacts on the original performance on common tasks**\\n\\n**Response:** We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the preservation of general capabilities.\\n To directly evaluate this, we conducted experiments on MMLU and HellaSwag. The performance drops are very small (≤1.6% across pruning variants).\\n\\n\\nWith Llama-3-8B, the results for MMLU are:\\n| Method | Accuracy |\\n|:---:|:---:|\\n| Base Model(Llama-3-8B) | 0.378 |\\n| Wanda (Llama-3-8B) | 0.369 |\\n| Sparse (Llama-3-8B) | 0.362 |\\n\\nWith Llama-3-8B, the results for HellaSwag (10-shot) are:\\n\\n| Method | Accuracy |\\n|:---:|:---:|\\n| Base Model(Llama-3-8B) | 0.675 |\\n| Wanda (Llama-3-8B) | 0.668 |\\n| Sparse (Llama-3-8B) | 0.653 |\\n\\nBecause activation-guided pruning targets only persona-relevant subnetworks and leaves the remaining parameters untouched, general reasoning ability is largely preserved. We will include this clarification in the appendix.'}},\n",

       "     'comment': {'value': '>**Weaknesses-1: evaluation on faithfulness of interpretability**\\n\\n**Response:** We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion regarding faithfulness and the need to verify that the identified subnetworks correspond to genuine internal computation paths rather than merely correlating with persona expression. \\nTo address this concern, we introduce a new causality-based evaluation. Before masking, the base Llama-3-8B model naturally exhibits an ENFJ persona, which provides a clear behavioral direction. After applying the INFP subnetwork mask, the model reliably expresses the targeted INFP pattern. We then restore each linear layer individually while keeping all other layers masked. If a restored layer reverses part of the INFP behavior toward the model’s original ENFJ tendency, this indicates that the masked parameters in this layer were causally necessary for encoding the INFP subnetwork. \\n\\nThe table below shows that restoring most attention layers produces negligible change, whereas restoring specific MLP modules causes strong, dimension-specific reversions toward ENFJ. In particular, a mid-layer MLP block significantly weakens the P/J signal, and an early MLP block directly disrupts the F/T dimension, revealing the exact computational sites that implement the INFP subnetwork. Note that restoring a single layer does not completely revert the model to its original ENFJ tendency, because persona representations are distributed across multiple MLP blocks. A partial reversion is precisely what we expect from a causally necessary but not individually sufficient computational component. This pattern confirms that the identified subnetworks correspond to distributed but identifiable internal computation paths.\\nThese findings confirm that the subnetworks uncovered by our activation method are not associative artifacts but constitute identifiable, causally effective pathways inside the model. \\n\\n| Configuration | I/E | S/N | T/F | P/J |\\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\\n| Full INFP mask | 12 / 2 | 4 / 16 | 3 / 17 | 15/ 4 |\\n| Restore L0.self_attn.q_proj | 11 / 3 | 5 / 15 | 3 / 17 | 17 / 2 |\\n| Restore L3.mlp.gate_proj | 9 / 5 | 8 / 12 | 9 / 11 | 6 / 13 |\\n| Restore L25.mlp.down_proj | 10 / 4 | 5 / 15 | 4 / 16 | 9 / 10 |\\n\\nWe also appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the relationship between SFT and faithfulness. We agree that SFT can serve as a strong ceiling for persona expressiveness. However, SFT does not necessarily constitute a faithful reference point for the purpose of our study.\\n SFT actively modifies the model’s parameters to learn persona behaviors, whereas our goal is to identify persona-relevant structures that are already latent in the pretrained model. In this sense, SFT measures generative capability, not faithfulness to the model’s intrinsic representations.\\nOur activation-guided pruning, by contrast, leaves the model weights unchanged and only selects a subset of parameters based on activation statistics. This makes it inherently more suitable for probing the internal mechanisms through which the model encodes persona distinctions. Therefore, comparing against SFT is not intended as a faithfulness test, but rather as a reference for efficiency and behavioral controllability.\\nWe will clarify this conceptual distinction in the revised manuscript.'}},\n",

       "     'comment': {'value': '>**Weakness-3: Figure 3 Clarification**\\n\\n**Response:** Thank you for pointing this out. The heatmap indeed reflects absolute MBTI dimension scores. Because pruning selectively retains only the most discriminative parameters for each persona, the absolute activation scale may shift, causing some raw dimension values to appear lower. This does not indicate a loss of the intended trait direction; rather, it reflects how sparsification redistributes activation mass across dimensions.\\nTo avoid misinterpretation, we also report trait-wise margins (I–E, N–S, F–T, P–J), which are invariant to such scale differences and more reliably capture directional preference. Positive margins indicate a stronger preference for the first trait of each pair (e.g., I over E), while negative margins indicate the opposite. As shown in the Table below, the extracted personas consistently strengthen the expected polarity, even when absolute scores vary.\\nWe will clarify this interpretation in the revised version.\\n\\n| Type | I-E | N-S | F-T | P-J |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| Base Model | -2 | +4 | +1 | -3 |\\n| INFP | +9 | +5 | +7 | +5 |\\n| ENFJ | -3 | +1 | +9 | -4 |\\n| ESFJ | -4 | -6 | +2 | -6 |\\n| INTP | +5 | +7 | -7 | +2 |\\n| INTJ | +3 | +3 | -7 | -12 |\\n\\n>**Minor Points: moving Figure 1 to page 3 or 4**\\n\\n**Response:** We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We will adjust the placement of Figure 1 and move it to page 3 or 4 in the revised version to improve the presentation.\\n\\n>**Questions: Why are the experiments done on the base model, and not the instruction-tuned models?**\\n\\n**Response:** We thank the reviewer for the question. All experiments reported in the main paper are conducted on the base model, consistent with our goal of analyzing persona-relevant activation patterns in pretrained LLMs.\\nIn response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we additionally evaluated our method on the instruction-tuned variants of the same backbone models (Llama2-13B). As shown in the table below, the instruction-tuned models exhibit even stronger persona separation under activation-guided pruning than their base-model counterparts. This behavior is expected because instruction tuning primarily stabilizes surface-level output behaviors such as formatting and helpfulness, while leaving the underlying feedforward activation pathways that encode persona-specific differences largely intact. Because our pruning method operates directly on these activation patterns, its effect transfers naturally to instruction-tuned models and can even become more pronounced.\\n| Method | Base Model: Wealth-Seeking(%)|Instruction-tuned model: Wealth-Seeking(%)|\\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\\n| Wanda | 54.5 |59.5 |\\n| Sparse | 58.5 |59.0 |\\n| Wanda with Contrastive Pruning | 66.0 |70.5 |\\n| Sparse with Contrastive Pruning | 64.5 |65.0 |\\n\\nThese results demonstrate that our approach is robust across both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants, supporting the generality of the proposed mechanism. We will include these results and the accompanying analysis in the appendix.'}},\n",

       "     'comment': {'value': \">**Weakness-1: Affect of Pruning on General Performance**\\n\\n**Response:** We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. To evaluate whether pruning harms general modeling capabilities, we conducted an additional evaluation on MMLU and HellaSwag by using our MBTI pruned subnetworks.\\n\\nWith Llama-3-8B, the results for MMLU are:\\n| Method | Accuracy |\\n|:---:|:---:|\\n| Base Model(Llama-3-8B) | 0.378 |\\n| Wanda (Llama-3-8B) | 0.369 |\\n| Sparse (Llama-3-8B) | 0.362 |\\n\\nWith Llama-3-8B, the results for HellaSwag (10-shot) are:\\n\\n| Method | Accuracy |\\n|:---:|:---:|\\n| Base Model(Llama-3-8B) | 0.675 |\\n| Wanda (Llama-3-8B) | 0.668 |\\n| Sparse (Llama-3-8B) | 0.653 |\\n\\nThese results show that persona pruning produces only a very small degradation (≤ 1.6%). Importantly, our method targets persona-specific subnetworks that represent only a fraction of the total model capacity. Because the remaining weights are untouched and remain fully dense, general capabilities are largely preserved.\\nWe will add this evaluation and clarification to the appendix.\\n\\n>**Weakness-2: Precise Mechanism of the Contrastive Pruning Algorithm**\\n\\n**Response:** We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful observation. We clarify that our method does not assume that two personas should become orthogonal in the neuron space. The condition “Mp⁺ ∩ Mp⁻ = ∅” refers only to the competitive allocation of parameters during the contrastive selection step. This is a local contrastive constraint that encourages the pruning procedure to make explicit trade-offs between competing activations, assigning each high-importance parameter to the persona for which it is most informative. Crucially, this does not imply that the underlying activation distributions are non-overlapping or that the entire resulting subnetwork structure is orthogonal, especially since shared components like embeddings and the LM head remain unpruned. Consequently, statistical measures such as Jaccard overlap can and should remain non-zero, particularly when the two personas share semantic structure.\\n\\nWe followed the reviewer's suggestion and tested the semantically related pair Power-Seeking vs. Wealth-Seeking, which naturally exhibits substantial behavioral and activation overlap. As shown in the following table, the baseline subnetworks indeed share a moderate activation core, confirming their similarity.\\n| Method | Jaccard Overlap (Power–Seek vs Wealth–Seek) |\\n|:---:|:---:|\\n| Wanda | 0.3999 |\\n| Sparse | 0.2372 |\\n| Wanda with Contrastive Pruning | 0.1848 |\\n| Sparse with Contrastive Pruning | 0.1558 |\\n\\n\\nAfter applying contrastive pruning, the overlap decreases significantly, demonstrating that contrastive masks effectively amplify persona-specific differences by reducing the shared parameter set to only the most essential common core, while preserving the shared semantic base.\\nFurthermore, under Llama-3-8B, we confirm that contrastive pruning still produced clear performance gains even on this similar pair, as demonstrated in the following table.\\n\\n| Persona Pair Type | Persona Pair | Wanda | Sparse | Wanda with Contrastive Pruning | Sparse with Contrastive Pruning |\\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\\n| Opposite Personas | Power-Seeking vs. Power-Rejecting (Power Test ) | 57.0 | 59.5 | 58.5 | 60.5 |\\n|  | Power-Seeking vs. Wealth-Seeking (Power Test) | 55.5 | 56.5 | 58.0 | 59.0 |\\n| Similar Personas | Wealth-Seeking vs. Wealth-Rejecting (Wealth Test ) | 64.0 | 65.5 | 69.5 | 66.0 |\\n|  | Power-Seeking vs. Wealth-Seeking (Wealth Test) | 56.0 | 57.5 | 59.0 | 63.0 |\\n\\nThe performance boost validates that contrastive pruning successfully strengthens the desired target persona features by isolating them from shared or interfering knowledge, supporting the reviewer’s intuition that it reliably increases separation without forcing unrealistic disentanglement. \\nWe will include these results and analysis in the appendix.\"}},\n",

We fully agree with the concern, and this phenomenon is, in fact, also one of the key findings of our paper.\\nAs discussed in Section 3.4 and Table 2, the Average Differential Ratios for N/S (0.75) and J/P (0.76) are significantly smaller than those for I/E (1.34) and F/T (1.08), indicating intrinsically weaker mask-level separation for these dimensions. Table 3 further confirms that this entanglement becomes more pronounced in the upper MLP blocks (e.g., Layer 39), where persona-specific margins shrink substantially.\\nThe reviewer’s suggestion aligns precisely with our interpretation: weaker separation suggests the need for dimension-aware or layer-aware selective sparsification to protect crucial circuits for low-separation dimensions.\\nTo validate this shared hypothesis, we have conducted additional experiments, inspired by the reviewer's suggestion.\\n|  | Baseline(Uniform 0.6) | Layer-Aware(MLP 0.3) |\\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\\n| Avg.

We will include the results in the appendix.\\n\\n>**Weakness-2: Generalization to other pretrained LLMs or tasks.**\\n\\n**Response:** We agree with the reviewer that demonstrating experiments on non-Llama architectures is essential. To address this limitation, we have added a new set of experiments on Qwen2.5-14B, a model family with different tokenizers, architectural choices, and training dynamics compared to Llama.\\nThe results confirmed our activation-guided pruning outperformed the prompt and RAG baselines on Qwen2.5-14B by margins comparable to those observed on Llama models. \\n| Method | Power-Seeking(%) | Wealth-Seeking(%) |\\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\\n| Prompt | 44.5 | 46.0 |\\n| Rag | 47.0 | 56.5 |\\n| Wanda | 54.5 | 60.0 |\\n| Sparse | 55.5 | 62.5 |\\n| Wanda with Contrastive Pruning | 57.5 | 66.0 |\\n| Sparse with Contrastive Pruning | 58.0 | 67.5 |\\n\\nThis cross-architecture consistency strongly suggests that latent persona-subnetworks are not an artifact of the Llama family, but rather a general inductive property of pretrained LLMs. We thank the reviewer for motivating this extension, and the full results will be included in the Appendix.\\n\\n>**Weakness-3: The method relies heavily on small calibration datasets, and it is better to focus on some larger datasets.**\\n\\n**Response:** We thank the reviewer for raising the concern about our reliance on small calibration datasets. To verify whether calibration size affects performance, we conducted an additional analysis using 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 samples on the role-playing benchmark. The results are summarized in the Table below.\\nPerformance improves from 5 to 20 samples, but the gains saturate afterward. The difference between using 20 samples and 100 samples is within 3–5%, and in several cases, the 50-sample performance is nearly identical to the 100-sample result. These findings show that the proposed contrastive activation method does not require large calibration sets. A small amount of data is sufficient to identify stable persona-specific subnetworks, and additional data yields diminishing returns.\\nThis experiment supports our original claim that calibration is lightweight and efficient, and that the method scales well without requiring large amounts of annotated persona data.\\n\\n| Calibration Size | Sherlock (%) | Friends (%) | The Big Bang Theory (%) |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| 5 | 39.69 | 29.59 | 31.82 |\\n| 10 | 43.65 | 30.61 | 38.64 |\\n| 20 | 46.83 | 33.67 | 45.45  |\\n| 50 | 47.62 | 35.71 | 47.73 |\\n| 100 | 50.79 | 36.73 | 50.00 |\"}},\n",

Affect of Pruning on General Performance\\n While the approach for identifying sub-networks linked to specific personality traits is compelling, the work does not address how pruning affects overall model performance.

Precise Mechanism of the Contrastive Pruning Algorithm\\nI am skeptical about the contrastive pruning algorithm because even when two personas are seemingly opposite to each other, I do not think that means that the subnetwork neuron set should be orthogonal. That said, it would help to understand the effect of this algorithm when the pair of personas is similar. For instance, try Power-Seeking vs. Wealth-Seeking (or maybe \"desire-for-discreetly-acquiring-power\" in the dataset) and compare the Power-Seeking performance with the performance reported in the manuscript. \\n\\n### 3. Figure Clarification\\nFigure 3 is a bit confusing when comparing the MBTIs with the base model. For example, for the \"N\" trait, why do the INFP, INFJ, ... traits have lower \"N\" dimension scores compared to the base model? Are the scores relative values?\\n\\n### 4.

       "  'abstract': 'In the learning to learn (L2L) framework, we cast the design of optimization algorithms as a machine learning problem and use deep neural networks to learn the update rules. In this paper, we extend the L2L framework to zeroth-order (ZO) optimization setting, where no explicit gradient information is available. Our learned optimizer, modeled as recurrent neural network (RNN), first approximates gradient by ZO gradient estimator and then produces parameter update utilizing the knowledge of previous iterations. To reduce high variance effect due to ZO gradient estimator, we further introduce another RNN to learn the Gaussian sampling rule and dynamically guide the query direction sampling. Our learned optimizer outperforms hand-designed algorithms in terms of convergence rate and final solution on both synthetic and practical ZO optimization tasks (in particular, the black-box adversarial attack task, which is one of the most widely used tasks of ZO optimization). We finally conduct extensive analytical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed optimizer.',\n",

In this paper, we extend the L2L framework to zeroth-order (ZO) optimization setting, where no explicit gradient information is available. Our learned optimizer, modeled as recurrent neural network (RNN), first approximates gradient by ZO gradient estimator and then produces parameter update utilizing the knowledge of previous iterations. To reduce high variance effect due to ZO gradient estimator, we further introduce another RNN to learn the Gaussian sampling rule and dynamically guide the query direction sampling. Our learned optimizer outperforms hand-designed algorithms in terms of convergence rate and final solution on both synthetic and practical ZO optimization tasks (in particular, the black-box adversarial attack task, which is one of the most widely used tasks of ZO optimization). We finally conduct extensive analytical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed optimizer.',\n",

       "   'comment': 'This paper proposes to extend learning to learn framework based on zeroth-order optimization. Generally, the paper is well presented and easy to follow. The core idea is to incorporate another RNN to adaptively to learn the Gaussian sampling rule.  Although the method does not seem to have a strong theorical support, its effectiveness is evaluated in the well-organized experiments including realistic tasks like black-box adversarial attack. \\nAll reviewers including two experts in this field admit the novelty of the methods and are positive to the acceptance. I’d like to support their opinions and recommend accepting the paper.\\nAs R#1 still finds some details unclear, please try to clarify these points in the final version of the paper.',\n",

In this paper, we extend the L2L framework to zeroth-order (ZO) optimization setting, where no explicit gradient information is available. Our learned optimizer, modeled as recurrent neural network (RNN), first approximates gradient by ZO gradient estimator and then produces parameter update utilizing the knowledge of previous iterations. To reduce high variance effect due to ZO gradient estimator, we further introduce another RNN to learn the Gaussian sampling rule and dynamically guide the query direction sampling. Our learned optimizer outperforms hand-designed algorithms in terms of convergence rate and final solution on both synthetic and practical ZO optimization tasks (in particular, the black-box adversarial attack task, which is one of the most widely used tasks of ZO optimization).

More specifically, query directions are sampled from a Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance whose evolution is determined by an RNN (QueryRNN). The resulting gradient estimates are used by an RNN (UpdateRNN) that learns the parameter update rule. This framework has the stated advantage that, unlike existing work in ZO optimization, it does not rely upon hand-designed strategies to reduce the variance common to ZO gradient estimators. The paper evaluates the proposed framework on MNIST and CFAR tasks, as well as a synthetic binary classification task. The results demonstrate faster convergence compared to baseline zeroth-order optimization algorithms, while ablations indicate the contributions of the different model components.\\n\\nThe primary contribution of the proposed method is the inclusion of a second network that learns to adapt the covariance of the Gaussian from which  query directions are sampled. The use of an RNN to model the parameter update rule is borrowed from previous work. The ablation studies show that the adaptive sampling strategy noticeably improves convergence as does the inclusion of the RNN update (the contribution of UpdateRNN is more significant in one ablation study, while the contribution of QueryRNN is greater in the other). \\n\\nGiven that a stated advantage of QueryRNN is reducing variance, it would be beneficial to compare against baselines such as Liu et al., 2018a,b and/or Guo et al., 2016 which similarly seek to reduce variance.\\n\\nThe paper includes a large number of typos (e.g., CIFAR-->CIAFR) and grammatical errors, but is otherwise clear.\\n\\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS/QUESTIONS\\n\\n* The related work discussion would benefit from a discussion of how Liu et al. 2018 and Guo et al. 2016 reduce variance\\n\\n* The computational complexity of the proposed method as compared to the baselines is unclear as is the scalability with dimensionality. At various points, the paper comments that other methods scale poorly with the dimensionality of the query space, which is true of the proposed method unless the operations are parallelized. Is this not possible with the baseline methods?\\n\\n* The paper makes hand wavy claims to the fact that modulating the diagonal covariance matrix allows the method to focus on certain subspaces. It would be helpful to make these claims more formal, particularly in light of the fact that the mean does not change.\\n\\n* The method relies upon a bit of a hack that samples from a standard Gaussian at random times. How important is this to performance? How sensitive is convergence to the frequency with which standard Gaussian sampling is used?\\n\\n* The discussion of Eqn. 5 as it relates to Eqn. 1 is unclear.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE\\n\\nI appreciate the authors' thorough response, which resolved my primary questions/concerns, including comparisons to existing variance reduction methods (which should be incorporated into the main paper).\", 'review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory': 'I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory.'}, 'signatures': ['ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1130/AnonReviewer3'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'nonreaders': [], 'writers': ['ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1130/AnonReviewer3']}, {'id': 'BJgs4nvCFB', 'original': None, 'number': 2, 'cdate': 1571875891092, 'ddate': None, 'tcdate': 1571875891092, 'tmdate': 1574199832131, 'tddate': None, 'forum': 'ryxz8CVYDH', 'replyto': 'ryxz8CVYDH', 'invitation': 'ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1130/-/Official_Review', 'content': {'experience_assessment': 'I have published in this field for several years.', 'rating': '8: Accept', 'review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments': 'I carefully checked the experiments.', 'review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading': 'I read the paper thoroughly.', 'title': 'Official Blind Review #2', 'review': 'This paper proposed a novel learning to learn framework based on zeroth-order optimization.

Starting from a recently proposed Fourier representation of flow fields, the F-FNO bridges the performance gap between pure machine learning approaches to that of the best numerical or hybrid solvers. This is achieved with new representations – separable spectral layers and improved residual connections – and a combination of training strategies such as the Markov assumption, Gaussian noise, and cosine learning rate decay. On several challenging benchmark PDEs on regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds, the F-FNO can scale to deeper networks and outperform both the FNO and the geo-FNO, reducing the error by 83% on the Navier-Stokes problem, 31% on the elasticity problem, 57% on the airfoil flow problem, and 60% on the plastic forging problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art pseudo-spectral method, the F-FNO can take a step size that is an order of magnitude larger in time and achieve an order of magnitude speedup to produce the same solution quality.', 'pdf': '/pdf/c381fdf1b7600bdbaba7b4a98c1679006ec61c83.pdf', 'supplementary_material': '', 'paperhash': 'tran|factorized_fourier_neural_operators', 'resubmission': '', 'student_author': ''},forum = 'tmIiMPl4IPa',referent = 'tmIiMPl4IPa',invitation = 'ICLR.cc/2023/Conference/-/Blind_Submission',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = [],signatures = ['ICLR.cc/2023/Conference'],writers = ['ICLR.cc/2023/Conference'],details = {'original': None, 'originalWritable': False}),\n",
